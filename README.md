# Not your grandma's tic tac toe

## Description
Normal tic tac toe is boring. Why? Because games end in ties 99.9% of the time! 
So lets switch things up. How about one player wins by getting the game to be a tie,
while the other player wins by either winning, or making the other person win (so losing). 
This isn't your grandma's tic tac toe!
